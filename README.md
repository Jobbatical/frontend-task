Front-end challenge
===================

This challenge is designed to assess the ability of a front-end candidate to solve real-world problems.

- Design for the task - https://invis.io/M6KHQTYEQ4D
- There are three screens in this prototype - Desktop view, Mobile View and Different form states

## Project description
Create a simple React application to add new skills, edit experience and remove skills. The simple API server with seed data is provided in this repo.

## Implementation instructions:
- Skills have a min length of 4 characters and a max length of 255 characters
- Responsiveness of the UI is mandatory
- Dropdown menu can be simple browser default HTML select - option component. *No need for custom dropdowns*
- UI doesn't need to be pixel perfect. Your UI should look pretty with similar user experience described in the design
- Add skills and delete skills functionality are mandatory

## Submission instructions
- Use github for the project and share the URL with us. Use your preferred git flow (Note: make the commit messages meaningful on master branch)
- Don't name the project with straight forward names like, `front-end-challenge-jobbatical`. Create your own random unique names for the project eg., `thanos-on-fire`, `summer-is-here`.
- In README file, give us instructions to run the project, Share details in readme if you want us to know before looking at your solution.

## Preferred technology stack
- React
- Redux and its supporting libraries (redux-thunk or redux-saga, etc)
- SCSS / LESS
- Webpack (production build, dev setup)
- font-awesome (or similar icon library if needed)
- Lodash (if needed)
- Testing (Jest / Mocha / Chai / Enzyme)

Remarks:

- Babel (ES6, ES7 and don't use ES5 syntax)
- Prefer to use promises, async / await syntax if needed
- eslint / Prettier (for code linting)
- Do **not** use jQuery or any similar library

## Evaluation criteria (in order of importance)
- Code organisation (React application structure)
- Code readability (including comments)
- Commit history - structure and quality
- Responsiveness and UI behaviour
- Adherence to the tech stack described above
- Completeness
- Test coverage

## README file Instructions
- How to run the project
- How long does it take you to finish it?
- Anything else you want to share with us along with the solution to boost your application (eg., about your current company tech stack if it is different from task's preferred stack)
- Don't provide any data related to the task which is searchable easily through Github search (eg., `jobbatical front end` or similar search shouldn't list your task repo in Github)
